For this assignment we were asked to create an Augmented Reality based experience using Unity3D and Vuforia. The aim was to improve our skills with Vuforia and learn how to create a unity-based game that implements Vuforia, and to learn how to create an apk package so the game could be packaged and played on an android phone. The target audience for this game was people from the ages of 13+ who have an android device. I chose to create a game of President trump collecting bricks to build a wall as I thought that it was relevant at the time of making the game as  it was a big topic around the world whether or not he would actually build a wall so I thought it would be funny to make a game about his goal of building a wall. The project was also beneficial to our design skills as we were tasked with creating an a4 poster for the game which would give instructions on how to play the game and stand out and grab people’s attention.
